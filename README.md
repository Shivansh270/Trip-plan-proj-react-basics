# Trip-plan-proj-react-basics
The React Trip project is a web app displaying cards of different cities to visit. Users can click on a card to see more information about the city and remove it if they're not interested. The app uses React components and a static dataset of the cities. This project is implemented using react basic concepts and javascript.
